      <h2>We Help You Make Time for the Work that Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Workforce and economic development organizations are under constant pressure to serve more employers and
        jobseekers and to demonstrate ROI for funders and policy decision-makers. BG Data Analytics uses internal workforce
         training data to report out and visualize a complete picture of data across programs to improve service delivery to
         youth and adults who are seeking employment, or who are looking for training to build skills and advance in their
        careers.

      <h2>Identify Patterns, Correlations and Other Insights</h2>
      <p>
      We know from years of workforce development experience that leveraging multiple funding streams and reporting requirements
       puts a real strain on internal resources, making it hard to use data internally for learning and program management.
       BG Data Analytics can help identify patterns, correlations and other insights to help your organization communicate
       impact to funders and stakeholders.
